## Plan

### Segment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Generate questions about your data, search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling your data, use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

Mentor: Javeria Nisar

### Segment 2: Inferential Statistics

Explore the phenomenon of sampling variablity, examine the Central Limit theorem as a way to quantify that variability and hence infer about the population. The Normal distribution and its usage, as a prerequisite to the CLT.

Mentor: Umair Rafique

### Segment 3: Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical Learning, need for models, notation to be used throughout the course, and some linear algebra.

Mentor: Umair Rafique

### Recommended reading/courses/exercises before next session:

- Chapters 1, and 3 (specifically sections 3.1 and 3.2, and exercises pertaining to those topics) of [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os) (freely available). Practice using the pnorm and qnorm functions in the exercises. It would be awesome if you manage to cover from chapter 1 all the way to the end of chapter 3 along with the exercises.

- Start off with R programming lessons in [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html), as well as the [Datacamp introduction to R course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
