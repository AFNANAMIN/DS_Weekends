# DS_Weekends
DS Weekend events by [Pakistan.AI](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1045006612234229/) in Karachi recreated for everyone around the world!

## Introduction
Ever since the inception of Pakistan.ai a couple of decades back, (yeah see we were the first. What? it says the group came into being a couple of years back only? Well friend, that's because Facebook is such a recent innovation, and we always wanted a low profile. ... ok, how about a middle ground? a decade fine? See we are still the first!) we have observed a consistent trend of people seeking guidance about how to enter the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence due to the bright prospects these fields have in the coming times (we were just way ahead of our times you see). Specifically, people seem to be confused about how and what to learn. With such a plethora of options and opinions we see online thanks to baba Google, most don't have any idea about what and whose opinion to trust with the time they will invest in learning. 

So who's gonna' come through when confusion reigns supreme, and the need for guidance is at its epitome? Yours truly, the one and only (we won't repeat our name again and again, like it's so arrogant, right?). 

So what the cool dudes at Pakistan.ai (that's us, and gals too, see we're all for inclusiveness, peace) did was, we went to firms that are working in the Data Science and analytics space, and making money out of it (let's be honest, we know nobody's learning for the love of 'ilm here), and talked to their CEO's. We asked them if they face any difficulty in finding the right human resource to work for them and earn some peanuts while they themselves make tons of money. And if they do, what exactly are the skills they are looking for, that they couldn't find people who possess them? 

So they were generous enough with their time to guide us through the skills people need to have if they want to help them make some serious dough, and we compiled a syllabus and gathered some expertise to teach those skills to you! And the best part is, wait for it \<Barney from HIMYM-style pause here>... we are doing the first iteration of our award-winning, FDA-approved, recognized-world-over-and-even-in-Mars course for ABSOLUTELY FREE!

[Here's a draft](https://github.com/PakistanAI/DS_Weekends/blob/master/Outline_draft.md) of what we plan to teach in the first module right now. We are trying to devise a syllabus that's a mix between skills you will need in your job, plus knowledge that will help you through the interview. We'll also help you create a github profile that has projects which showcase skills that are sought-after. It's very cool, really. More effective than the amazing manjan you bought in your bus route the other day.

## Course Logistics
The course is composed of 12 sessions, each session happening on a weekly basis. Each session will be then further subdivided into 3-2 sections where a certain topic will be taught. Students who do not show up for 2 sessions will be disqualified from the workshop overall. The software from [here](https://github.com/PakistanAI/DS_Weekends/blob/master/Installation.md) must be installed to be able to follow along with the sessions.
