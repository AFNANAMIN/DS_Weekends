## Plan

### Segment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Generate questions about your data, search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling your data, use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

Mentor: Javeria Nisar

### Segment 2: Inferential Statistics

Explore the phenomenon of sampling variablity, examine the Central Limit theorem as a way to quantify that variability and hence infer about the population. The Normal distribution and its usage, as a prerequisite to the CLT.

### Segment 3: Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical Learning, need for models, notation to be used throughout the course, and some linear algebra.
