## Plan

### Segment 1: Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical learning, the need for models. Simple Linear Regression

### Segment 2: Visualization with R 1

Continuing from the visualizatoin techniques learned in the EDA segment in the past, this would be a further exploration of the plotting libraries in R

### Segment 3: Inferential Statistics

After having done with the proofs of the Central Limit Theorem and the Standard Error, we will finally get our hands dirty with extracting Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. We will also try to cover the t-distribution, and confidence intervals and hypothesis testing using the t-distribution
