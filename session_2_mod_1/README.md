## Plan

### Segment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Continued from previous session. Generate questions about your data, search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling your data. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.

Mentor: Javeria Nisar

### Segment 2: Inferential Statistics

Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing using the CLT (big, scary words right? piece of cake actually. Just hold on). The t-distribution. Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing using the t-distribution.

Mentor: Umair Rafique

### Segment 3: Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical learning, notation, Simple Linear Regression.

Mentor: Zaid Memon

### To read before next session:

Sections 4.1 and 4.2 from chapter 4. And all the previous chapters along with all the exercises. Remember people: the reading you do between the sessions will actually define what you learn. Not the sessions themselves.
